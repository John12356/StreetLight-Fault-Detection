## Introduction

The Street Light Fault Detection IoT project is a cutting-edge initiative designed to enhance the efficiency of urban lighting infrastructure. By deploying smart sensors on street lights and leveraging Internet of Things (IoT) technology, the system monitors real-time data to detect faults and anomalies. A user-friendly web application serves as a centralized platform, providing administrators with instant insights, alerts, and historical data, ultimately contributing to cost savings, improved public safety, and optimized urban lighting management.
## Features

- **Real-time Monitoring:** Constantly monitors the status of street lights in real-time, providing up-to-the-minute information on their operational status.
- **Fault Detection Algorithms:** Utilizes sophisticated algorithms to analyze sensor data, promptly identifying faults such as bulb failures, power supply issues, or abnormal light intensity.
- **Instant Alerts:** Administrators receive immediate notifications through a web application, enabling swift response to faults and efficient maintenance.
- **User-Friendly Web Application:** A graphical interface allows administrators and maintenance teams to easily access and interpret data, promoting efficient decision-making.
- **Cost Efficiency:** Early fault detection minimizes maintenance costs by addressing issues promptly, contributing to overall cost efficiency.
- **Improved Public Safety:** Ensures well-lit streets by promptly addressing faults, enhancing public safety in urban environments.
- **Energy Consumption Optimization:** Analyzes data to optimize energy consumption by efficiently managing the operation of street lights.
- **Scalability:** Designed to scale, accommodating the integration of additional street lights and expanding coverage as urban infrastructure evolves.

## Technologies Used
- **React.js**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **HTML5 & CSS3**: Markup and styling languages for building web pages.
- **JavaScript**: A programming language for adding interactivity to web applications.
- **NodeJS**: Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that allows developers to execute JavaScript code server-side.
- **ExpressJS**: Express.js is a minimal and flexible web application framework for Node.js.
- **Gmaps :** Google Maps is a web-based mapping service that provides interactive maps, real-time traffic information, and location-based services.
